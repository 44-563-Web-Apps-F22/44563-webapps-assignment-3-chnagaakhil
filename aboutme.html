    <hr>
    <p> I love to travel and partake in activities to find new adventures along the way. 
        I found my interest in technology whole comes from <br> the experience of learning about 
        various subjects during my schooling days as well as working with different groups in 
        the college.<br> I believe that achieving goal is not difficult unless you have the passion
        and the willpower to possess it in your peroid of life.

    <h1> Avengers : Age of Ultron </h1>
    <p> The Main concept of the movie is Artificial Intelligence. The Avengers we're created to 
        save the humanity from extinction from greater physical threats like alien invasion. The 
        Ironman (Tony Stark) wants to create an army of robots to defend the earth from upcoming
        dangers from the space and maintain peace of all time i.e Creating Ultron. But Ultron sees 
        that the humanity creates the war to rule the earth and fight one country against another 
        using new strategies. So he acknowledges that the peace on earth is possible only by the 
        extinction of humanity and the Avengers. Later, the Avengers defend the earth and kill ultron
        including his memories that effects others. This explains the high-sight and technology 
        advancement issues in the movie including the teamwork to protect the planet you love and live on.
